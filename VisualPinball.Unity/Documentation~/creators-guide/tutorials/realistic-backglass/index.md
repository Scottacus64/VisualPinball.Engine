# Create a Backglass

This tutorial runs through the workflow for making the color and mask artwork, creating a mesh in Blender and importing that mesh and artwork up in Unity to create a working backglass.

## Overview

The result of this workflow is a pinball backglass that is properly sized and contains color artwork along with a light blocking thickness map:

## Prerequisites
